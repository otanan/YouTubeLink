## Examples
One example is subscriptions.py which pulls newest videos from subscriptions and queues them into a custom Watch Later playlist.

Another example is pull_channel.py which grabs all uploads from a given channel and adds them to a custom channel-dependent Watch Later playlist in chronological order.
